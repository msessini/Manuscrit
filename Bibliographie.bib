abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.}

abstract = {Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions at s=7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb−1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb−1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.}

We derive constraints on the CP-violating Higgs-boson couplings to top and bottom quarks as well as to tau leptons from low-energy bounds on electric dipole moments, resumming large logarithms when necessary. The present and future projections of the sensitivities and comparisons with the LHC constraints are provided. Non-trivial constraints are possible in the future, even if the Higgs boson only couples to the third-generation fermions.},

Specific angular distributions in the h→τ+τ−, τ±→ρ±ν̄τ(ντ) decay chain can be used to probe mixing angles of scalar–pseudoscalar hττ couplings. In the discussion of the feasibility of the method, assumptions on the properties of a future detector for an e+e− linear collider such as TESLA are used. The Standard Model Higgsstrahlung production process is taken as an example. For the expected performance of a typical linear collider set-up, the sensitivity of a measurement of the scalar–pseudoscalar mixing angle turned out to be 6°. It will be straightforward to apply our results to estimate the sensitivity of a measurement, in cases another scenario of the Higgs boson sector (Standard Model or not) is chosen by nature. The experimental error of the method is expected to be limited by the statistics.}

Angular distributions of the τ decay products which are sensitive to the Higgs boson parity are defined and are found to be measurable using typical properties of a future detector for an e+e− linear collider. The prospects for the measurement of the parity of a Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV are quantified for the case of e+e− collisions of 500 GeV center of mass energy with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1.

We use a method which allows one to determine the scalar--pseudoscalar Higgs mixing angle {\$}{\$}{\backslash}phi {\_}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}in this decay mode. This mixing angle can be extracted from the distribution of a signed angle, denoted by {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varphi {\_}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}CP{\}}^{\{}*{\}}{\$}{\$}, which we analyze for the major charged-prong {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}decays. For definiteness, we consider Higgs-boson production by gluon fusion at NLO QCD. We take into account also the irreducible background from Drell--Yan production, {\$}{\$}Z^*/{\backslash}gamma ^*{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}tau {\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}, at NLO QCD. We compute, for the signal and background reactions, angular and energy correlations of the charged prongs and analyze which type of cuts suppress the Drell--Yan background. An important feature of this background is that its contribution to the distribution of our observable {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varphi {\_}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}CP{\}}^{\{}*{\}}{\$}{\$}is a flat line, also at NLO QCD. By separating the Drell--Yan {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}events into two different sets, two different non-trivial {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varphi {\_}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}CP{\}}^{\{}*{\}}{\$}{\$}distributions are obtained. Based on this observation we propose to use these sets for calibration purposes. By Monte Carlo simulation we study also the effect of measurement uncertainties on this distribution.

A CP-violating effect would manifest itself in these decay modes in characteristic spin-spin correlations of the tau lepton pairs which can be accessed using the momenta and impact parameters of the charged tau decay particles. We examine a CP-sensitive observable for a 125 GeV Higgs boson resonance in the gluon fusion channel at the LHC. Furthermore, we consider the distribution of this observable for the irreducible Drell-Yan background. By splitting these events into two categories we obtain two different distributions which can be used for calibration purposes.

abstract = {The mass of the Z boson has been determined by combining the data from the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL. The dominant error arises from uncertainties in the calibration of the energy of the beams in LEP. A programme of investigations including energy calibration by resonant depolarization of transversely polarized beams has led to a significant reduction of the uncertainty on the Z mass compared with the precision achieved with the 1990 data. The mass of the Z is measured to be MZ = (91.187±0.007) GeV.}

abstract = {This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its   performance during Run 1 of the LHC.  The trigger system consists of   two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest   from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion)   collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in   hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent   with an electron, photon, muon, τ lepton, jet, or missing   transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based   algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing.  The   trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity   during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz,   the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second   level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the   output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event   storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger   system during the LHC Run 1 are described.}

Data values (generally of more than one dimension) are binned, and because the numbers of data points in many bins are small, a χ2 minimisation is inappropriate, so a maximum likelihood technique using Poisson statistics is often used. This note shows how to incorporate the fact that the Monte Carlo statistics used are finite and thus subject to statistical fluctuations.}

journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {Many measurements and searches for physics beyond the standard model at the LHC rely on the efficient identification of heavy-flavour jets, i.e. jets originating from bottom or charm quarks. In this paper, the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated t̄ events, these new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification of a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15%, compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition, for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies, as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The b jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV).}
